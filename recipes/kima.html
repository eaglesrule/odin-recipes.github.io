    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This Greek version of pasta and a tomato-based meat ragu is a traditional dish that appears 
            in numerous versions across the country. Although makaronia me kima is incredibly versatile 
            and can be easily adapted with additional ingredients, it is usually distinguished by the use
             of fragrant spices such as cinnamon or cloves in the meat ragu.</p>
        
        <p>It is a classic comfort dish that is typically garnished with grated cheese.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef               </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (optional)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced             </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced           </li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine                  </li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley     </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon      </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano          </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried mint             </li>
            <li>Kosher salt, to taste             </li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce     </li>
            <li>1/4 cup water                     </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup, optional   </li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter    </li>
            <li>1 pound pasta                     </li>
            <li>Grated Mizithra cheese, or Kefalotyri cheese, to taste, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a 4-quart saucepan, brown ground beef over medium-high heat until all pink color disappears.
                 If ground beef is very lean, add 2 tablespoons olive oil before adding onion and garlic.</li>

            <li>Add onions and saute until translucent. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about a minute. 
                Add wine and allow it to simmer a minute or two before adding the next ingredients.</li>

            <li>Add parsley, cinnamon, oregano, mint, salt, pepper, tomato sauce, and water. Bring heat down
                 to low and simmer uncovered for at least 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                 This is also a good time to boil the water for your pasta.</li>

            <li>Add ketchup, if using, and butter, stir and let cook a minute or two.
                 (The flavors of the sauce will develop the longer it sits, and it's 
                 sometimes even better the second day after you make it.)</li>
                 
            <li>Prepare pasta according to package directions. Serve pasta with meat sauce and grated cheese.</li>

        </ol>
